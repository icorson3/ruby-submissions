# Game Time Check In # 1

## Basics

### Team
- [Ilana Corson](https://github.com/icorson3)
- [Charles Kaminer](https://github.com/ckaminer)

### Game Name

1603

### Give a Basic Description of the Game

Similar to 2048, with pictures of students of 1603 instead of numbers.

### Include a Link to or Screen Shot of the Game

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Tiles move around the screen with arrow keys.
- When two tiles of the same picture hit together, they become a different picture.
- Each tile will also have a number value assigned.
- There will be a hierarchy of images to show what value they represent.
- When an arrow button is pushed, a new tile appears.
- The game ends when either the score 2048 (a certain person) or the board fills with tiles.
- When the game is won or lost, the game automatically resets with a "play again" button.
- Crazy Mode is instructor's pictures without a hierarchy of who is what number.
- The score increases when you add each tile together. 4+4 = 8 points.
- The session keeps track of the total score.

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Tiles move around the screen with arrow keys.
- Each tile will also have a number value assigned.
- When an arrow button is pushed, a new tile appears.
- The game ends when either the score 2048 or the board fills with tiles.
- When the game is won or lost, the game automatically resets with a "play again" button.

### What have you accomplished so far?

We have created a canvas and put some basic bootstrap into the project. We have also completed the logic for the game tiles, on paper.

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

We are concerned about making the logic and animation pieces work together.

# Instructor Feedback Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

* 50: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has completed some wireframing and/or written code.
* 40: First check in form and README was completed and pull requested in. Team has a well documented plan for moving forward with their game. Team has not written any code or created any wireframe documents.
* 25: First check in form completed but shows little effort at documenting/planning and team has not written any code.
* 0: First check in form was not completed.

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: _eg. Create snake head constructor that draws itself on the canvas_

* Goal 2: _eg. Stop snake from moving past the boundry of the canvas when moving - write tests_

* Goal 3: _eg. Configure jshint and .jshintrc_

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* _ie. Goals that are not required to meet the checkin, but would be good to have. Completion may result in extra credit points_
